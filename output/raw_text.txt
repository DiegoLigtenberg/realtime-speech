 So, we made a text to SpeechModel, however, is that very interesting? Oh, my bad, it was a speech to textModel. But is that very interesting? I think it's only interesting if you combine it with some Autologic, and wouldn't it be great if that Autologic was machine learning base as well? We made a machine learning model that can input Speech, and output a summarized version of it. Isn't that cool? I think it definitely is. Great.
