## Whisper UI - Transcriptions, Summaries & Analytics

---

#### Run Whisper
- Add a YouTube URL or select a local file on the left
- Select the right Whisper model supported by your machine (extra configs have other whisper params if you want to play around with them)
- Select whether you want to summarize the video. If so, enter a minimum and maximum length for the summary (usually between 50 and 100 words). Note that only the first 8 minutes of the video can be summarized in the current version.
- Click Save settings.
- Click "Transcribe"

Once a transcription is created, it will be retained as a session variable so you can navigate around raw, summarized and time-annotated output.
However, if you refresh or add a new video, the old transcription will be replaced.
